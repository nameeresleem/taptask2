        During my years of study, I participated in many extracurricular activities within the university,
         the most notable of which <br> was entering the Hult Prize and reaching the semi-finals in it.
         <br> I also joined a group of training courses, which benefited my studies, such as the project management course,
          <span> Photoshop design, and Illustrator </span> <br>, and then I learned some simple skills that. It is related to the frontend language,
         and after that I loved this field and wanted to continue in it, so I decided to register in your academy
